I hear that you've been spreading rumors about my involvement in villager disappearances, and that is just totally not cool. It's worse than that - it's libel! Or perhaps it's slander. I guess it depends on whether you've been carving pictographic representations of these accusations in stone? Regardless, let's settle our differences. Let me buy you a scone and a latte at the cute cafe that's just opened atop our temple."/>
