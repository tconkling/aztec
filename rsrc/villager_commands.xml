    <command action="SACRIFICE" affinity="0.3" text="Sweet {name}, would you do me a solid and run to the top of our completely non-sacrificial temple? I left my shaman's staff up there and I'm screwed without it. You're the best."/>
    <command action="SACRIFICE" affinity="0" text="Sweet {name}, what a beautiful day it is! The sun is shining! The birds are chirping! Truly, we are blessed by our Gods. Please - join me for a stroll to the top of our temple, so that we can offer our thanks to these deities."/>
    <!--<command action="SACRIFICE" affinity="0" text="Sweet {name}. Listen, we need to talk. You've been acting totally stand-offish recently. I hear that you've been spreading rumors about my involvement in villager disappearances, and that is just totally not cool. It's worse than that - it's libel! Or perhaps it's slander. I guess it depends on whether you've been carving pictographic representations of these accusations in stone? Regardless, let's settle our differences. Let me buy you a scone and a latte at the cute cafe that's just opened atop our temple."/>-->

    <command action="WORSHIP" affinity="0" text="Wonderful {name}, we mere mortals have but one duty in life. We must please our gods, that they continue to cause the sun to rise in the morning, the rain to water our crops, and the mosquitos to plague our foes, that they might have horrible diarrhea!"/>

    <command action="FESTIVAL" affinity="0" text="Fabulous {name}, you've had a hard day. Look at those tired eyes, those calloused feet. I have just the thing for you. Now - don't walk away, hear me out! For your own good, and as your local shaman... no, as your FRIEND, I INSIST you take a vacation; you're killing yourself with the long hours you've been putting in at the office!"/>
