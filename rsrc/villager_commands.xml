    <command action="SACRIFICE" affinity="0.5" text="Sweet {name}, I implore you to take a tour of our wonderous temple! There's a prize waiting for you at the top! Seriously, your name was drawn randomly. Riches await you!"/>
    <command action="SACRIFICE" affinity="0.5" text="Sweet {name}, would you do me a solid and run to the top of our completely non-sacrificial temple? I left my shaman's staff up there and I'm screwed without it. You're the best, for real."/>
    <command action="SACRIFICE" affinity="0.3" text="Sweet {name}, what a beautiful day it is! The sun is shining! The birds are chirping! Truly, we are blessed by our Gods. Please - join me for a stroll to the top of our temple, so that we can offer our thanks to these deities."/>
    <command action="SACRIFICE" affinity="0" text="Sweet {name}. Listen, we need to talk. You've been acting totally stand-offish recently. I hear that you've been spreading rumors about my involvement in villager disappearances, and that is just totally not cool. It's worse than that - it's libel! Or perhaps it's slander. I guess it depends on whether you've been carving pictographic representations of these accusations in stone? Regardless, let's settle our differences. Let me buy you a scone and a latte at the cute cafe that's just opened atop our temple."/>

    <command action="WORSHIP" affinity="0.3" text="Wonderful {name}. I know! It's a Sunday morning and you'd rather be watching the big game. But be a mensch and spend some time worshipping at the temple, yeah? It'll do you good."/>
    <command action="WORSHIP" affinity="0" text="Wonderful {name}, we mere mortals have but one duty in life. We must please our gods, that they continue to cause the sun to rise in the morning, the rain to water our crops, and the mosquitos to spread plague amongst our foes, that they might have horrible diar.. diarrhhea? No, that's not it. Diharrea? Diarrhea? Regardless! Worship-time."/>

    <command action="FESTIVAL" affinity="0.5" text="Fabulous {name}, you've been working so hard. Take a break! Go to the festival! Dance like nobody's watching!"/>
    <command action="FESTIVAL" affinity="0.3" text="Fabulous {name}, it's your birthday! We gonna party like it's your birthday! We gonna sip... divine Octli, like it's your birthday? And - I don't need to tell you this - we don't actually give a fuck that it's not your birthday."/>
    <command action="FESTIVAL" affinity="0" text="Fabulous {name}, you've had a hard day. Look at those tired eyes, those calloused feet. I have just the thing for you. Now - don't walk away, hear me out! For your own good, and as your local shaman... no, as your FRIEND, I INSIST you take a vacation; you're killing yourself with the long hours you've been putting in at the office! Tell me - when did you last really take some me-time? We all need it. We really do. So head over to that festival and dance!"/>
